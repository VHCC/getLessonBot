# Establish LineBot by [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) 

Develoyed to aws via serverless.

## Requirements

```bash
npm install -g serverless
serverless config credentials --provider aws --key [AWS Access Key ID] --secret [Secret Access Key]
sls deploy
```
Notes: needs serverless.yml to be a serverless project, and in this file, service will be the aws lambda name as the result.
